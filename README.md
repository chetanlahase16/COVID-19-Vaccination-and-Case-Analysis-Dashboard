COVID-19 Vaccination and Case Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 vaccination progress, gender-based data distribution, negative test counts, positive cases, and recovery trends. 
The dashboard is designed to visualize key statistics and trends, making it easier to track and assess the impact of the pandemic. It is interactive, allowing users to filter data by state and year for more focused insights.



Key Features:

1. Vaccination Statistics:
   - Total vaccinations administered: 
     - First Dose: 30 billion
     - Second Dose: 8 billion
   - Gender distribution: 
     - Males: 20 billion
     - Females: 1,702
   - Vaccine types: 
     - Covaxin: 5 billion doses 
     - Covishield: 33 billion doses

2. Negative Cases by Month:
   - Monthly breakdown of negative test counts, highlighting the months with the highest negative test results.
   - Top months for negative tests: May (659) and June (593).

3. Positive Cases by Month:
   - Visualization of positive cases using a donut chart.
   - Significant months for positive cases include:
     - August: 3.56K
     - December: 3.5K
     - November: 3.5K

4. Recovery Trends:
   - Monthly trends for confirmed cases and recoveries, depicted using a clustered column chart.
   - Highlights recovery and confirmed case numbers for each month, showcasing recovery progress.

5. Interactive Filters:
   - State Selection: Allows users to focus on specific states for a localized analysis.
   - Year Selection: Provides insights for the years 2020 and 2021.



Purpose:
The dashboard aims to help stakeholders (e.g., government authorities, healthcare providers, and researchers) monitor and evaluate COVID-19-related data to make informed decisions. 
The design emphasizes clarity, allowing users to identify trends and patterns effectively.



How to Use:

1. Select a state and year from the dropdown filters for customized data views.
2. Review vaccination statistics to understand the distribution and coverage.
3. Analyze monthly trends in negative and positive cases.
4. Track confirmed and cured cases to assess recovery trends over time.

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged for data visualization and storytelling, making complex datasets accessible and actionable.
